# OPS-006 Plan

1. Verify backend can start and pass health checks; record ports and any conflict handling.
2. Run required unit tests in order (`dotnet test` first, then `frontend` unit tests) and record outputs.
3. Build frontend artifacts and run backend-served UI path for E2E checks.
4. Execute Edge MCP validation using Edge with dedicated user-data-dir (`.automation/edge-profile`) and verify key interactions.
5. Check backend logs for runtime errors during UI verification.
6. Update bilingual report, `.automation/tasks.json`, and `.automation/state.json` with execution status and evidence.
7. Commit and push focused changes after all checks pass.

## Risks / Missing Inputs
- OpenCode/Edge MCP runtime may be unavailable in this environment.
- Remote repository may not be configured for push.
- GLM provider quota can block AI call paths unrelated to local app startup.
