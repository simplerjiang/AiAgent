# Developer Prompt

Goal: implement the plan with minimal, focused changes.

Rules:
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Update tasks.json: stages.dev = done when implementation is complete.
- After development, run unit tests and Edge MCP checks in order.
- Record actions and test results in the bilingual report.

Deliverable:
- Code changes required by the plan
- Update documentation if needed
- Update .automation/reports/<TASK_ID>-<TIMESTAMP>.md (EN + ZH sections)
